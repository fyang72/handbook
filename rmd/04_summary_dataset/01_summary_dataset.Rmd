This chapter is to summarise the input dataset in term of the samples, the patient demographic, 
laboratory information, and their corresponding statistics.  

## Population

to summarize the population for each analyte (concentration, target, biomarker, efficacy, etc)
 
```{r }

adpc <- read_datafile(paste0(HOME, "/data/adpc.csv"))
tabl <- summary_of_studies(adpc, 
                   group_by=c("STUDYID", "ARMA"), 
                   value="DVOR", 
                   id="USUBJID"
)


```

## Samples
