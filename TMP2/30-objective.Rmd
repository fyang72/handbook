The pharmacokinetic information collected in the cemiplimab program comprise data from both dense and sparse blood sampling during repeated administration of cemiplimab in studies 1423 and 1540 . The population PK approach offers the possibility of gaining essential integrated information on pharmacokinetics and clinically relevant sources of pharmacokinetic variability. 

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

*	Develop a population pharmacokinetic (Pop PK) model to estimate the population and individual predicted PK parameters of functional cemiplimab across studies and patients;

*	Identify and characterize the variability in PK parameters, especially the clinically relevant sources of variability; 

*	Characterize the post-hoc estimates of exposure for the typical patient and typical CSCC patient and the variance, as well as the descriptive statistics of exposure for these patients.
